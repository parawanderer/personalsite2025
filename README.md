# Personal Website 2025

## Notes

I was curious how far and artistic you can go with Javascript these days since the last personal webpage I had. I think back then having animated SVGs was the "new thing", hence I included that in my old (very basic) personal web page.

This time I decided to mess around with [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)/[Three.js](https://threejs.org/). This is after having messed around in basic [OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) in C++ a while ago -- Three.js is less annoying to use: mainly due to already having written all the classes I was essentially writing from scratch in OpenGL ðŸ˜› (honestly I'm surprised how similar their API design turned out to be to the stuff I was making up on the fly with my OpenGL experiment!).

I liked the idea of having a "pretty, custom, interactive" background with the whole page following the same "theme", and I thought making something "artsy" looking in 3D could be the next level of improvement to my page.

I started off with the idea of a [basalt columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnar_jointing) "tunnel/ravine" scene (because I really like the geometry of these things) with water, and after looking at a bunch of inspiration pictures from search results like "`basalt columns fantasy art`" I came up with this. I tried to have a "`Glasmorphism`" theme, mostly because I'd recently read about this trend in UI design and liked the way it looks.

Mind me, I'm a generalist SWE that lately mostly did distributed systems/backend. So excuse the rather hobbyist-looking design ðŸ˜›


## Issues

- I wrote this while looking at a desktop computer browser and it's really built around being viewed on a browser, not all mobile device resolutions/orientations are supported.
- I was too lazy to implement my own mobile controls (the module I used from three.js for the keyboard controls does not support mobile out-of-the-box). So no mobile fly around in the 3d world for now. Which probably removes most of the value of this design, because you can't even clearly see the background at that point.
- It seems that even on my rather overpriced "gaming" laptop, there's some issue where when trying to render my "glitching" animation on top of some more "complex" (in the sense of a lot of things changing simultaneously) WebGL animation in the background, such that even my laptop starts having hickups. I suppose it fits the "glitching" theme, but this isn't really intentional.
- It's not as optimised as it could be. More stuff (particularly time-bound position updates for e.g. the particles) could be moved into the shaders
- Honestly no idea if this will run on the average visitor's computer lol. For me it was hitting 230 FPS relatively consistently, but YMMV
- It's not automatically unit-tested whatsoever! There are certainly a few classes that could be tested, and I suppose you could write some headless browser automated test if you really wanted to be thorough
- I wanted to add a "glitch" effect in the actual 3D environment but ended up being too lazy to set it up. Something like [this one](https://domenicobrz.github.io/webgl/projects/experiment1/) has would be neat, but this requires way more setup than just using the glitch effect.
- Apparently Firefox doesn't support the rotating cards with glassmorphism/blur. That's too bad.

## Development

#### Prerequisites

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) with `npm` (initially built using `v20.16.0`)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) knowledge. (Javascript knowledge will probably do, it's easy enough to infer)
- [GLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language) knowledge for some of the shader edits

### Running Locally

Clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parawanderer/personalsite2025.git
cd personalsite2025
```

Run it:

```bash
npm i
npx vite
```

The website becomes available at `http://localhost:5173/`

### Building "production" build

```bash
npx vite build
```
